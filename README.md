# Weaveworld

**Weaveworld (á¿¶)** is an experimental framework for interactive web applications, to provide the theoretically shortest (!) representation for "data-intensive" applications (forms, etc.) using simple HTML and JS techniques, without loss of readability. Only basic (!) HTML/CSS/JavaScript(ES6 or ES5) skills are required to create applications.

**License**: it is _free_ to use, but _**not** open-source_ during its experimental phase (i.e., it is not allowed to use elsewhere parts or modified versions of the source, however the framework is totally customizable); patent pending for the "type-binding" technique. See: [licence](LICENSE).

A [simple example to do list](demo/simple-todo).
